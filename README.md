# Handwritten_digits_classification

  Handwritten digit classification is a classic machine learning project that uses the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The goal is to train a model to accurately classify the digits based on their pixel values.

**Dataset**
-->MNIST Dataset
A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Image Size: 28x28 pixels (flattened into 784 features for each image).
Classes: 10 (digits 0 through 9).
Train-Test Split:
60,000 training images.
10,000 testing images.

**Methadology**
1. Loading the Dataset.
2. Data Normalization: Scaling pixel values between 0 and 1 improves training stability.
3. Data Flattening: Flattening data from 2-D array to single Dimensional Array.
4. Building a Model:
